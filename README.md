- Planning to have a small real instance (both John and Andreas) for arc-based routing
- arc-based routing has it's own challenges (classical metaheuristics struggle with it, like simulated annealing/genetic algorithm/ant colony optimization) but also opportunities (smaller problems, tighter graph constraints and structure)
- Eventually leave with some animation of routing-based on Linkedin
