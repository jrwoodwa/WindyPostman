- Planning to have a small real instance (both John and Andreas) for arc-based routing
- Arc-based routing has it's own challenges (classical metaheuristics struggle with it, like simulated annealing/genetic algorithm/ant colony optimization, significantly less academic research on it than node-based) but also opportunities (problems may be better modeled as ARP than NRP, tighter graph constraints and structure)
- Eventually leave with some animation of routing-based on Linkedin
